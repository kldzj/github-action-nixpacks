- [ ] switch to newline only splitting
- [ ] docker image for execution so we don't need mapping and installing nixpacks each time?
- [ ] cron to automatically rebuild container each month for nixpacks upgrades?
- [ ] support non-ghcr for multi arch builds
- [x] can we push and build in parallel to optimize gh actions billing time?
